# 42 - Born2Code! :computer:
A continually updated collection of links to the various projects I completed as a candidate during the C-Piscine, as well as projects I will be working on as a student at 42Madrid.

❗ If you are a 42 student, I strongly suggest not to copy my code. Instead, I encourage you to use it as a reference.
